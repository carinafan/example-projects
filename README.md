# Example projects

This repository has examples of code I've written for past personal and professional projects.

## Episodic & spatial memory
[episodic-spatial-memory](https://github.com/carinafan/example-projects/tree/main/episodic-spatial-memory) - contains R scripts for analyzing and visualizing a set of online questionnaires to study the relationship between memory and imagery.

These analyses and figures were published in a peer-reviewed journal; the article is available [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-020-01093-7).
